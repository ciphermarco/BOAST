Package httplogger is a fork of the go-chi router's middleware package. Thus, the
original MIT License below applies.

Note: the original code is more useful for general imports since this is mostly the
result of removing some of the parts that are not being used here, making it less general.

So, check go-chi middlewares: https://github.com/go-chi/chi/tree/master/middleware
